# info-blog
personal blog for publishing latex courses and materials

# compiling
to deploy this blog use the compile script provided (currently EXPERIMENTAL) by giving it a path to a folder of .tex files, each corresponding to a course. Afterwards you will have a static bundle (as a zip), easily deployable with CDN.
